  "title": "Aunt Maria's Apple Pie",
  "story": "Legend has it that on a misty morning in 1897, Aunt Maria awoke from a dream so vivid she could still taste the perfect apple pie on her lips. The dream had shown her an orchard hidden in the mist-shrouded hills, where the apples had been kissed by both sun and moon. Determined to recreate this otherworldly pastry, Maria embarked on a journey across three counties, sampling apples from every orchard she encountered. One fateful evening, as autumn painted the countryside in gold and amber, she stumbled upon an old gnarled tree at the edge of a forgotten meadow. The tree, locals whispered, had been planted by a wandering monk who carried apple seeds blessed by a mysterious order. Maria gathered exactly seven apples—no more, no less—and hurried home through a sudden thunderstorm. As lightning illuminated her small kitchen, she began to bake, guided by the recipe that had appeared in her dream. The aroma that filled the house was so enticing that neighbors from miles around found themselves inexplicably drawn to her door. Since that night, Maria's apple pie has been served at every family gathering, the recipe closely guarded and passed down only to those deemed worthy of its secret. They say that whoever eats a slice of this mythical pie will be blessed with good fortune, and that the final bite should always be saved for midnight, when wishes made upon it are said to come true. The pie itself seemed to glow with an inner light, each slice revealing layers of perfectly caramelized apples arranged in a spiral pattern that resembled the golden ratio found in nature's most beautiful creations.",
